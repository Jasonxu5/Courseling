# Courseling

Courseling is a Google Chrome extension that allows the user to perform searches for computer science courses at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. There are two primary search functions available to the user:

1. The user can input an arbitrary query, receiving a ranked list of the Top 5 courses that are most relevant to the user's query.
2. A specific course can be queried, which returns a detailed description of the course, including things like its credit hours, semesters offered, etc.

## Project Demo
The video demonstration can be viewed on YouTube at https://youtu.be/JrTYH2-sKFU.

## Important Support Note
This extension has compatibility issues with MacOS computers that we've spent hours trying to fix but still cannot seem to resolve.
Because of this, you **must** build and run the extension on a **Windows machine or VM**

## Build and Run the Extension
Please read the above note, this extension is only compatible with Windows machines

1. Clone the repo to the desired directory (`git clone https://github.com/Jasonxu5/Courseling.git`)
2. In a terminal, cd to the Courseling repo and MAKE sure you are in the root repo
    - If you run `ls`, you should see the output of `client`, `data`, `flask-server`, etc.
3. Setup a conda environment where Python is **version 3.7 or below**. This is very important. Otherwise, the metapy package will fail to install.
    1. Download and install the Anaconda version for Python 3.7
    2. Open a terminal and run `conda create -n Counseling python=3.7`
    3. Activate the environment using `conda activate Courseling`
4. Run command `pip install -r requirements.txt` which will install all the required Python modules
5. Next, make sure you have npm installed (https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
6. Navigate to the `client` folder and then run the commands `npm install` and `npm run build`
7. The command should generate a new `build` folder in the client folder
8. Go to `chrome://extensions` and make sure developer mode is enabled
9. Click on the option to "Load unpacked" and select the `build` folder that you just generated
10. Now go back to the repo and navigate to the `flask-server` folder
11. Run the command `python server.py` and this should start up the flask server
12. Now click on the extension (the icon looks like a mortarboard on top of a screen). You can pin the extension for easier access.
13. You should then be able to make queries and get a output of the top courses and their scores


## Architecture Overview
In order to collect the required data to train our text retrieval ranking function, we used a MongoDB NoSQL database to store all of the computer science courses at UIUC and their relevant information.

The underlying architecture of the extension follows the client-server model. On the backend, there is a server built using Flask in Python. We utilize the BM25 algorithm provided by the metapy library to perform ranking logic on the user's input, generating either a list of courses or directly indexing our database to return all information related to that specific course. The output of this logic is sent to the frontend Google Chrome extension client interface built in JavaScript. From there, it is rendered and displayed underneath the search bar.
