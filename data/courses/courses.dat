It now helps us realize a variety of seemingly impossible tasks: from allowing computations on secret data without revealing the data itself, to offloading computation to untrusted clients while maintaining verifiable results, and even making programs unintelligible while preserving functionality. This course will cover a selection of such cutting-edge topics in modern cryptography. We will understand how an adversary that breaks advanced protocols can be transformed into an adversary that contradicts a basic assumption such as the hardness of factoring. Our focus will be on understanding key ideas in cryptography research published over the last few years, and identifying new directions and problems for the future. This is a seminar course in Cryptography. Students will be expected to read and discuss research papers in the second part of the course."
