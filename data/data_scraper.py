  "This course will be a literature review of recent papers on compilers and optimization techniques for resource-constrained heterogeneous parallel systems used in edge computing. Such systems increasingly use specialized, domain-specific accelerators to deliver the necessary performance and energy efficiency under tight resource constraints. We will begin with a brief discussion of example domains important in edge computing applications, e.g., computer vision, image processing, speech processing, SLAM, and autonomous control systems. The course will then cover relevant papers in the areas of compilers, optimization techniques, and accuracy-performance-energy tradeoffs for such systems.", \
  "Portable High Performance Computing means portable performance in time and space. In other words, the performance of programs requiring HPC (resource intensive codes) need to be portable across the main existing architectures and across the machines that will be developed in time. In order not to have to rewrite entire applications to port them across systems we raise the level of abstraction at which programs are written and leave the details of mapping the application onto the architecture to the vendors themselves. One way to achieve portable performance of applications and ease of programming effort is to use a hierarchical system of generic and domain specific libraries. Libraries can be built on top of the existing software development infrastructure, i.e. do not require new compilers, debuggers, etc. performance Libraries have to implement parallel algorithms and programs without requiring the user to deal with the complexities of parallel program execution on a parallel", \

  "In undergraduate algorithms classes, you have studied classical problems such as all-pairs shortest paths, longest common subsequence, edit distance, 3SUM, subset sum, triangles in graphs, etc. Have you ever wondered whether the textbook algorithms you have learned could be improved, or whether they are in fact the best possible? Here, we are interested not just in determining whether the problems are polynomial-time solvable, but in their fine-grained complexity (quadratic time? cubic time? etc.). We will describe the latest theoretical techniques for obtaining (slightly) improved algorithms for these classical problems and their variants (in general as well as important special cases). We will also prove conditional lower bounds via reductions that relate the fine-grained complexity of one problem to another.
